# Textab
Textab is a set of Python scripts utilizing regular expressions (Regex) to extract key statistics from text files. Today, many researchers use programming languages such as R to analyze data from their research projects, often generating output in txt file format. Extracting key statistics, such as effect size, p-values, and odds ratios, from these files can be time-consuming and challenging. With Textab, you can efficiently and easily extract essential statistics from the output of programming languages, significantly streamlining the process.

## Supported inputs

## Contributing
We are at the start of a long journey. Numerous programming languages and statistical tests generate text-based outputs, which Textab can convert into tabular data containing key numerical statistics. We welcome your suggestions for improving or fixing any bugs in the existing scripts and invite your contributions to help develop future scripts, expanding the range of supported inputs.
